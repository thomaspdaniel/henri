## 1. Simple: REST API Endpoint Addition

**Complexity Level**: Low (3-4 agents, linear workflow)

### Scenario Description
Add a new user profile update endpoint to an existing REST API

### Agent Roster
- **Database Agent**: Add `profile_updates` audit table
- **API Agent**: Implement PUT /users/:id/profile endpoint
- **Verifier Agent**: Validate database schema and API implementation

### Workflow Characteristics
- **Dependency Chain**: Linear (database → API)
- **Domain Focus**: Single domain (backend only)
- **Validation Criteria**: Tests pass, endpoint works
- **Architectural Decisions**: Minimal (patterns already established)
- **Risk Level**: Low (existing patterns can be followed)

### Why This Fits the Orchestration System
- Demonstrates basic agent coordination
- Simple validation checkpoints
- Clear completion criteria
- Minimal escalations expected
- Good starting point for understanding the system

## 2. Medium: User Authentication System

**Complexity Level**: Medium (6-8 agents, parallel + sequential work)

### Scenario Description
Implement complete user authentication with JWT tokens, password reset, and email verification

### Agent Roster
- **Solution Architect Agent**: Choose JWT library, token storage strategy, email service
- **Database Agent**: Create users, sessions, password_reset_tokens tables
- **API Agent**: Login, logout, register, password reset endpoints
- **Email Service Agent**: Email template system, SMTP integration
- **Frontend Agent**: Login forms, session management, protected routes
- **Security Verifier Agent**: Validate password hashing, token security, SQL injection protection
- **Integration Verifier Agent**: End-to-end authentication flow testing

### Workflow Characteristics
- **Dependency Chain**: Mixed (parallel and sequential)
  - Database work must complete before API work
  - Frontend can start after API specification defined
  - Email service independent until integration phase
- **Domain Focus**: Multi-domain (database, API, email, frontend)
- **Validation Criteria**: Security requirements, integration testing, user flows
- **Architectural Decisions**: Multiple (technology choices, security patterns)
- **Risk Level**: Medium (security implications, integration complexity)

### Key Coordination Points
- **Parallel Work Opportunities**: Frontend and email service can develop concurrently with API implementation
- **Architectural Decisions Required**:
  - JWT library selection
  - Token storage strategy (in-memory, Redis, database)
  - Email service provider
  - Password hashing algorithm
- **Validation Checkpoints**:
  - Security audit before deployment
  - Integration testing across all components
  - Performance testing for authentication flow

### Proof of Concept Opportunities
- Email delivery reliability (test SMTP configuration)
- Token expiration and refresh strategy (validate approach with prototype)

### Why This Fits the Orchestration System
- Multiple domains requiring coordination
- Parallel execution opportunities
- Architectural decisions need Solution Architect Agent
- Risk assessment valuable for security and integration points
- Cross-domain validation required
- Demonstrates escalation resolution for technology choices

## 3. Complex: Multi-Tenant SaaS Migration with Legacy System Integration

**Complexity Level**: High (12+ agents, significant PoCs, workflow adaptation expected)

### Scenario Description
Migrate single-tenant legacy application to multi-tenant SaaS with data isolation, billing integration, and backwards-compatible API

### Agent Roster

#### Architecture & Planning Agents
- **Solution Architect Agent**: Multi-tenancy strategy, data isolation approach, migration plan
- **Risk Assessment & Validation Agent**: Identify migration risks, design PoCs for data migration patterns, validate PoC evidence

#### Discovery & Analysis Agents
- **Legacy Analysis Agent**: Document existing system assumptions, API contracts, data schemas

#### Database & Migration Agents
- **Database Migration Agent**: Add tenant_id columns, partition strategy, migration scripts
- **Data Migration Agent**: Execute tenant data migration with rollback capability

#### Application Development Agents
- **API Compatibility Agent**: Maintain v1 API while building v2 multi-tenant API
- **Billing Integration Agent**: Integrate Stripe/payment provider with tenant management
- **Frontend Refactor Agent**: Add tenant context, organization switching, user permissions

#### Testing & Validation Agents
- **Performance Testing Agent**: Load testing for multi-tenant queries, data isolation overhead
- **Security Audit Agent**: Verify tenant data isolation, cross-tenant access prevention
- **Integration Verifier Agent**: End-to-end testing across all components

#### Deployment Agents
- **Deployment Agent**: Blue-green deployment strategy, rollback procedures

### Workflow Characteristics
- **Dependency Chain**: Complex with potential circular dependencies
  - Legacy analysis must complete before migration planning
  - Database migration must complete before data migration
  - API v2 specification needed before frontend work
  - Billing integration depends on tenant management implementation
- **Domain Focus**: Enterprise-level (database, API, frontend, billing, deployment, security)
- **Validation Criteria**: Performance benchmarks, security audit, data integrity, backwards compatibility
- **Architectural Decisions**: Critical (multi-tenancy strategy, data isolation, migration approach)
- **Risk Level**: High (data loss risk, performance concerns, backwards compatibility)

### High-Risk Assumptions Requiring PoCs

#### PoC 1: Multi-Tenant Query Performance
- **Risky Assumption**: "Multi-tenant queries with tenant_id filtering will meet performance requirements"
- **Evidence Required**: Load testing results showing query performance within acceptable ranges
- **Success Criteria**: 95th percentile response time < 200ms for multi-tenant queries
- **Failure Scenario**: If performance unacceptable → triggers workflow adaptation for indexing strategy or data partitioning approach

#### PoC 2: Legacy Data Migration
- **Risky Assumption**: "Legacy data can be migrated without loss or corruption"
- **Evidence Required**: Sample migration of representative dataset with validation
- **Success Criteria**: 100% data integrity verification, no data loss
- **Failure Scenario**: If data quality issues found → triggers workflow adaptation to add data cleaning phase

#### PoC 3: Backwards Compatibility
- **Risky Assumption**: "V1 API clients will work without changes after migration"
- **Evidence Required**: Integration tests with actual v1 client applications
- **Success Criteria**: All v1 client tests pass against migrated system
- **Failure Scenario**: If incompatibilities found → triggers workflow adaptation for compatibility layer

#### PoC 4: Tenant Data Isolation
- **Risky Assumption**: "Row-level security will prevent cross-tenant data access"
- **Evidence Required**: Security audit results, penetration testing
- **Success Criteria**: Zero cross-tenant data leaks in security testing
- **Failure Scenario**: If isolation breached → escalates to Solution Architect for architecture redesign

### Expected Escalation Scenarios

#### Escalation 1: Data Quality Issues
**Scenario**: Legacy Analysis Agent discovers inconsistent email formats during analysis
- **Escalation**: "Legacy system uses inconsistent email formats - PoC reveals 15% data quality issues"
- **Resolution Path**: Risk Assessment Agent evaluates PoC evidence → triggers Workflow Adaptation Agent to insert data cleaning phase before migration
- **Impact**: Workflow restructured to add Data Cleaning Agent before Data Migration Agent

#### Escalation 2: Performance Requirements Not Met
**Scenario**: Performance Testing Agent finds multi-tenant queries 3x slower than requirements
- **Escalation**: "Multi-tenant query performance fails to meet requirements (600ms vs 200ms target)"
- **Resolution Path**: Escalates to Solution Architect Agent for index strategy redesign or partitioning approach
- **Impact**: May require Database Migration Agent rework, additional PoC for new approach

#### Escalation 3: Circular Dependency Detection
**Scenario**: Billing Integration Agent repeatedly escalates questions about tenant identification
- **Loop Detection**: Same question appears 3 times (tenant ID format, tenant ID generation, tenant ID validation)
- **Resolution Path**: Loop Detection Agent identifies circular dependency → Workflow Adaptation Agent restructures workflow to add Tenant Management Agent as predecessor
- **Impact**: Workflow restructured to break dependency cycle

### Workflow Adaptation Examples

#### Adaptation 1: Insert Data Cleaning Phase
**Trigger**: PoC reveals data quality issues
**Changes**:
- Add Data Cleaning Agent before Data Migration Agent
- Update dependencies: Data Cleaning Agent depends on Legacy Analysis Agent
- Update dependencies: Data Migration Agent now depends on Data Cleaning Agent
- Add verification checkpoint: Data Quality Verifier Agent

#### Adaptation 2: Add Caching Layer
**Trigger**: Performance PoC shows unacceptable query latency
**Changes**:
- Add Cache Strategy Agent to design caching approach
- Add Cache Implementation Agent to implement Redis/Memcached layer
- Update API Compatibility Agent dependencies to include cache implementation
- Add Performance Regression Testing to validation checkpoints

#### Adaptation 3: Break Circular Dependencies
**Trigger**: Loop detection on tenant management questions
**Changes**:
- Insert Tenant Management Agent early in workflow
- Update Billing Integration Agent dependencies to include Tenant Management
- Update Frontend Refactor Agent dependencies to include Tenant Management
- Resolve escalation loop by providing tenant management foundation

### Validation Checkpoints

1. **Legacy Analysis Complete**:
   - All API contracts documented
   - All data schemas mapped
   - All business logic assumptions captured

2. **PoC Validation Gate**:
   - Performance PoC results evaluated
   - Migration PoC results evaluated
   - Security PoC results evaluated
   - Workflow adaptation decisions made

3. **Migration Readiness**:
   - Database migration scripts tested
   - Rollback procedures validated
   - Data migration tested on sample dataset

4. **Security Audit Gate**:
   - Tenant isolation verified
   - Cross-tenant access prevention tested
   - Security vulnerabilities addressed

5. **Deployment Readiness**:
   - Integration tests passing
   - Performance benchmarks met
   - Backwards compatibility verified
   - Blue-green deployment tested

### Why This Fully Exercises the Orchestration System

**Risk Assessment & Validation**:
- Multiple high-risk assumptions identified during design
- PoC tasks inserted early in workflow
- PoC evidence evaluated to determine proceed/adapt/escalate

**Workflow Adaptation**:
- PoC results trigger surgical workflow updates
- Circular dependencies require workflow restructuring
- Planning gaps revealed through escalations

**Escalation Resolution**:
- Complex architectural decisions route through Solution Architect
- User requirements questions validated through Escalation Resolution Agent
- Workflow changes coordinated through Workflow Adaptation Agent

**Loop Detection**:
- Repeated escalations indicate fundamental design gaps
- Loop Detection Agent analyzes root causes
- Workflow restructured to break dependency cycles

**Multi-Agent Coordination**:
- Parallel workflows with synchronization points
- Complex dependency chains
- Multiple domain specializations
- Evidence-based completion drive validation

**Verification Workflow**:
- Multiple verifier types (security, integration, performance)
- Failed verification triggers rework loops
- Evidence requirements specified upfront
- Retry limits prevent infinite loops

This scenario demonstrates the orchestration system operating at full capacity with all architectural components engaged.
