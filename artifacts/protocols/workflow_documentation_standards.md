# Workflow Documentation Standards Protocol

## Purpose
This protocol establishes comprehensive standards for documenting workflows that prevent specification gaps, false completion claims, and role confusion while maintaining efficiency and quality. It addresses critical issues of evidence validation, success criteria quantification, and agent role separation.

## Core Principles

### 1. Evidence-Based Validation
- Every workflow step must specify quantitative, measurable success criteria
- Methodology documentation is mandatory for all completion claims
- Independent verification prevents conflicts of interest
- Audit trails must be complete and verifiable

### 2. Role Separation
- Execution agents focus on task completion with evidence collection
- Quality control agents focus on verification and evidence auditing
- Risk assessment agents focus on risk evaluation and classification
- No agent may assess their own work quality or risk level

### 3. Systematic Documentation
- "Definition of Done" requirements prevent subjective interpretation
- Evidence specifications must be independently verifiable
- Quality checkpoints have explicit validation criteria
- Confidence ratings follow evidence-based methodology

## Definition of Done Requirements

### Quantitative Success Criteria
Every workflow step must include:

```markdown
**Success Criteria:**
- Quantitative metric: [specific number/percentage/count]
- Measurement method: [how the metric is calculated]
- Validation approach: [how completeness is verified]
- Acceptable variance: [tolerance for the metric]

**Example:**
- Quantitative metric: 100% of existing tables documented
- Measurement method: COUNT(*) from information_schema.tables vs documented tables
- Validation approach: Cross-reference with database schema dump
- Acceptable variance: 0% (all tables must be documented)
```

### Evidence Specifications
Each step must define what constitutes proof of completion:

```markdown
**Required Evidence:**
- Primary evidence: [main deliverable/output]
- Supporting evidence: [methodology documentation]
- Validation evidence: [independent verification results]
- Audit trail: [step-by-step process documentation]

**Example:**
- Primary evidence: Updated table documentation files
- Supporting evidence: SQL queries used to extract schema information
- Validation evidence: Schema comparison report showing 100% coverage
- Audit trail: Log of all tables processed with timestamps
```

### Scope Boundaries
Define what "comprehensive" and "complete" mean:

```markdown
**Scope Definition:**
- Inclusion criteria: [what is covered]
- Exclusion criteria: [what is explicitly not covered]
- Boundary conditions: [edge cases and their handling]
- Completeness definition: [specific meaning of "done"]
```

## Evidence Documentation Standards

### Mandatory Methodology Documentation
All completion claims must include:

1. **Tools and Queries Used**
   ```sql
   -- Example: Document all SQL queries used
   SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type
   FROM information_schema.columns
   WHERE table_schema = 'production';
   ```

2. **Search Methods Applied**
   ```bash
   # Example: Document all search commands used
   grep -r "CREATE TABLE" /path/to/sql/files/
   find . -name "*.sql" -exec grep -l "ALTER TABLE" {} \;
   ```

3. **Systematic Coverage Proof**
   - Record counts before and after processing
   - Cross-reference checks against authoritative sources
   - Gap analysis showing what was not processed and why

### Before/After Documentation
For any claimed changes:

```markdown
**Before State:**
- Baseline measurement: [specific metric]
- Documentation: [screenshot/file content/query result]
- Timestamp: [when baseline was captured]

**After State:**
- Final measurement: [specific metric]
- Documentation: [screenshot/file content/query result]
- Timestamp: [when final state was captured]
- Delta: [quantified change]
```

### Complete Audit Trail
Document every step taken:

```markdown
**Process Log:**
1. [Timestamp] - [Action taken] - [Result] - [Evidence location]
2. [Timestamp] - [Action taken] - [Result] - [Evidence location]
...

**Files Modified:**
- [File path] - [Type of change] - [Lines affected] - [Backup location]

**Queries Executed:**
- [Query text] - [Results count] - [Purpose] - [Output location]
```

## Quality Control Specifications

### Agent-Specific Validation Checklists

#### For Execution Agents
```markdown
**Execution Agent Checklist:**
□ Quantitative success criteria met with evidence
□ All methodology steps documented with examples
□ Before/after states captured with measurements
□ Complete audit trail provided
□ No self-assessment of quality or risk performed
□ All required evidence artifacts provided
```

#### For Quality Control Agents
```markdown
**Quality Control Agent Checklist:**
□ Verified methodology documentation is complete and reproducible
□ Confirmed quantitative metrics using independent methods
□ Validated before/after evidence authenticity
□ Checked audit trail completeness and consistency
□ Assessed evidence quality against protocol standards
□ Identified any gaps requiring additional evidence
```

#### For Risk Assessment Agents
```markdown
**Risk Assessment Agent Checklist:**
□ Analyzed methodology for potential failure points
□ Evaluated impact scope using provided evidence
□ Assessed rollback feasibility based on documentation
□ Classified risk level with supporting rationale
□ Provided evidence-based recommendations
□ No involvement in task execution that could create bias
```

### Evidence Audit Requirements
Quality control agents must:

1. **Independently Verify Metrics**
   - Re-run queries to confirm reported counts
   - Cross-check measurements against source systems
   - Validate calculation methods used

2. **Assess Documentation Completeness**
   - Verify all required evidence types are present
   - Check that methodology can be reproduced
   - Confirm audit trail has no gaps

3. **Challenge Incomplete Evidence**
   - Document specific evidence gaps found
   - Request additional documentation when needed
   - Escalate to user when evidence standards are not met

### Challenge Resolution Process
When quality control identifies issues:

1. **Document the Gap**
   ```markdown
   **Evidence Gap Identified:**
   - Missing element: [specific requirement not met]
   - Impact: [how this affects validation]
   - Required action: [what needs to be provided]
   - Deadline: [when evidence must be provided]
   ```

2. **Execution Agent Response Required**
   - Must provide requested evidence or explain why it's unavailable
   - Cannot mark task complete until quality control approves
   - Must document any methodology changes made

3. **User Escalation Criteria**
   - Evidence cannot be provided due to technical limitations
   - Disagreement on evidence requirements interpretation
   - Quality control agent unavailable for extended period

## Hybrid Risk Classification System

### Initial Risk Assessment (Risk Assessment Agent)
```markdown
**Risk Classification Evidence:**
- Impact scope: [systems/data affected with counts]
- Failure scenarios: [specific failure modes identified]
- Rollback complexity: [effort required with time estimates]
- Dependencies: [other systems/processes affected]
- Historical precedent: [similar changes and their outcomes]

**Risk Level Recommendation:** [High/Medium/Low]
**Supporting rationale:** [evidence-based justification]
```

### User Validation and Override Authority
```markdown
**User Risk Review:**
- Agent recommendation: [High/Medium/Low with rationale]
- User assessment: [Accept/Modify/Override]
- Additional considerations: [user-specific factors]
- Final risk classification: [High/Medium/Low]
- Approval status: [Approved/Rejected/Conditionally Approved]
```

### Conflict of Interest Prevention
- Execution agents cannot classify risk for their own work
- Quality control agents cannot assess their own validation work
- Risk assessment agents cannot evaluate risks for tasks they designed
- All cross-agent interactions must be documented

```

### Bad Examples

❌ **Bad: Incomplete Evidence Specification - Missing Methodology**
```markdown
**Success Criteria:**
- All tables documented

**Required Evidence:**
- Documentation files created
```
**Problem**: No quantitative metrics, no measurement method, no validation approach, no acceptable variance defined. "All tables" is not measurable without defining scope and providing counts.

❌ **Bad: Vague Success Criteria - No Quantification**
```markdown
**Pool Calculation Validation:**
- Pool calculations verified successfully
- Results look correct
```
**Problem**: No specific record IDs, no count of records verified, no measurement method specified, no definition of "successful" or "correct".

❌ **Bad: Self-Assessment Without Independent Verification**
```markdown
**Quality Assessment:**
- I reviewed my work and it looks good
- All requirements appear to be met
- Confidence: 95%
```
**Problem**: Execution agent is assessing their own work quality, violating role separation principle. No independent quality control agent validation. High confidence rating without supporting evidence.

❌ **Bad: Confidence Rating Without Supporting Evidence**
```markdown
**Confidence: 90%**
```
**Problem**: No calculation methodology shown, no evidence factors listed, no uncertainty factors documented, no explanation of how 90% was derived.

❌ **Bad: Incomplete Audit Trail - Missing Key Information**
```markdown
**Process Log:**
1. Ran queries
2. Updated files
3. Validated results
```
**Problem**: No timestamps, no specific query names, no result counts, no output locations, no file paths, no evidence that can be independently verified.
