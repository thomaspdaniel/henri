# Protocol Executive Summary Project - Session Context

## Background

Tom has 12 protocol documents in `~/.claude/protocols/` created over at least a month. These protocols guide Claude's behavior across different domains. Tom has lost track of what they all do and needs better knowledge management.

## Problem Identified

**Knowledge management failure across two dimensions:**
1. **Tom (human)**: Can't recall which protocols exist, what they do, or when to use them
2. **Claude (AI)**: In fresh sessions, doesn't have quick way to understand the full protocol ecosystem

## What We Learned

### Protocol Types (per protocol_authoring_standards.md)

**Type A: Standards Protocols**
- Define quality requirements and compliance criteria
- Examples: verification_completion_standards.md, database_documentation_standards.md
- Structure: Purpose → Core Principles → Requirements → Examples → Enforcement

**Type B: Workflow Protocols**
- Step-by-step processes with user interaction
- Examples: document_update_review_protocol.md, requirements_creation_workflow.md
- Structure: Overview → Prerequisites → Workflow Steps → Error Handling → Example Usage
- **Key insight**: These have "sunny day" execution flows that can be visualized

**Type C: Specification Protocols**
- Technical specs and reference material
- Examples: freeplane_creation.md, glossary_standards.md
- Structure: Purpose → Technical Specs → Implementation Guidelines → Templates

### Mind Map Discovery

Tom created a Freeplane mind map for document_update_review_protocol.md (Type B workflow) that:
- Extracted only the happy-path workflow (ignored error handling, prerequisites, examples)
- Grouped 8 workflow steps into conceptual phases: requirements → backup → analysis → resolve issues → implementation → verification → resolve issues → cleanup
- Used higher-level thinking (e.g., "analysis" instead of "Launch Pre-Implementation Review Agent")
- Served as an executive summary for quick re-familiarization

This led to the realization: **Protocols need executive summaries for human quick reference**

## Key Decisions Made

### Executive Summary Requirements
1. **Purpose**: Help Tom (and fresh Claude sessions) quickly understand protocol ecosystem
2. **Audience**: Optimized for human consumption; Claude reads only when needed
3. **Format**: Well-designed summaries can replace need for mind maps AND enable rapid mind map generation if desired
4. **Location**: Single catalog file at `~/.claude/protocols/README.md`
5. **Structure**: Group by protocol type (A/B/C), sort alphabetically within groups
6. **Claude.md integration**: Add trigger so Claude knows to read README when needed

### Summary Creation Process
Since Tom may not be super familiar with protocols anymore, we agreed:

**Refamiliarization approach**: Claude presents key protocol information, Tom asks clarifying questions until comfortable

**Summary creation**: Discussion-based - Tom and Claude discuss what should be in summary, then Claude drafts based on conversation

**Pacing**: One protocol at a time, using fresh Claude session for each

**No blind drafting**: Claude does NOT create first draft without Tom's input - must collaborate to ensure accuracy

## Executive Summary Format

### Core Fields (All Protocol Types)

```markdown
**[Protocol Name]**

**Problem Solved:** [1-2 sentence description of why this exists]

**Documents Involved:** [List of file types/documents, or "None - conceptual standards"]

**Subagents Involved:** [List of agent roles/types, or "None - single agent execution"]

**Type:** [Standards / Workflow / Specification]
```

### Additional Field for Type B (Workflow Protocols)

```markdown
**Workflow Overview:**
1. [High-level phase 1] → 2. [Phase 2] → 3. [Phase 3] → etc.

OR (for agent-heavy workflows):

**Workflow Overview:**
[Agent A] → [User review] → [Agent B] → [User approval] → [Agent C] → [Completion]
```

### Example Summaries

**Document Update Review Protocol**

**Problem Solved:** Prevents errors, inconsistencies, and missed changes when updating documentation by using independent review agents at each critical stage.

**Documents Involved:**
- Original document being updated
- Proposed changes document (temporary)
- Backup file (temporary)

**Subagents Involved:**
- Pre-Implementation Review Agent
- Implementation Agent
- Post-Implementation Validation Agent

**Type:** Workflow

**Workflow Overview:**
Draft Changes → Backup → Pre-Review (agent) → Fix Issues → Implement (agent) → Validate (agent) → Fix Issues → Cleanup

---

**Database Documentation Standards Protocol**

**Problem Solved:** Prevents undocumented database schemas that require reverse-engineering to understand, maintain, and modify.

**Documents Involved:** SQL files (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE statements)

**Subagents Involved:** None - single agent execution

**Type:** Standards

## Next Steps

### In Fresh Session
1. ✅ **Design executive summary format**: Define what fields/structure each summary should contain (may vary by type A/B/C)
2. ✅ **Create instructions for "Protocol Summary Creation" workflow**: Added to ~/.claude/protocols/protocol_authoring_standards.md in "Protocol Executive Summary Creation" section
3. **Begin creating summaries**: One protocol per session using the workflow in protocol_authoring_standards.md (see "Creation Workflow for Existing Protocols")
4. **Generate README.md**: Once all summaries approved, compile into final README at ~/.claude/protocols/README.md
5. **Update ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md**: Add reference to README with appropriate triggers
